      "my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as\n",

      "passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea\n",
      "as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.  I abandon the glory and\n",
      "distinction of such offices to those who like them.  For my part, I\n",
      "abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations\n",
      "of every kind whatsoever.  It is quite as much as I can do to take\n",
      "care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs,\n",
      "schooners, and what not.  And as for going as cook,--though I confess\n",
      "there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer\n",
      "on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though\n",
      "once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and\n",
      "peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to\n",
      "say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.  It is out of the\n",
      "idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted\n",

      "huge bake-houses the pyramids.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\n",
      "plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\n",
      "True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\n",
      "spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at first, this sort of\n",
      "thing is unpleasant enough.  It touches one's sense of honour,\n",
      "particularly if you come of an old established family in the land,\n",
      "the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.  And more than\n",
      "all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have\n",
      "been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys\n",
      "stand in awe of you.  The transition is a keen one, I assure you,\n",
      "from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of\n",
      "Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.  But even\n",
      "this wears off in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a\n",
      "broom and sweep down the decks?  What does that indignity amount to,\n",
      "weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think\n",
      "the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I\n",
      "promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular\n",
      "instance?  Who ain't a slave?  Tell me that.  Well, then, however the\n",
      "old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch\n",
      "me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;\n",
      "that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same\n",
      "way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and\n",
      "so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each\n",
      "other's shoulder-blades, and be content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\n",
      "paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\n",
      "penny that I ever heard of.  On the contrary, passengers themselves\n",
      "must pay.  And there is all the difference in the world between\n",
      "paying and being paid.  The act of paying is perhaps the most\n",
      "uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon\n",
      "us.  But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?  The urbane activity\n",
      "with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering\n",
      "that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly\n",
      "ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.  Ah! how\n",
      "cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\n",
      "exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.  For as in this world,\n",
      "head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\n",
      "you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\n",
      "Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\n",
      "the sailors on the forecastle.  He thinks he breathes it first; but\n",
      "not so.  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in\n",
      "many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect\n",
      "it.  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea\n",
      "as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a\n",
      "whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who\n",
      "has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and\n",
      "influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than\n",
      "any one else.  And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage,\n",
      "formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a\n",
      "long time ago.  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo\n",
      "between more extensive performances.  I take it that this part of the\n",
      "bill must have run something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n",
      "\"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.\n",
      "\"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,\n",
      "the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\n",
      "others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and\n",
      "short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in\n",
      "farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I\n",
      "recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the\n",
      "springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under\n",
      "various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did,\n",
      "besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting\n",
      "from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great\n",
      "whale himself.  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all\n",
      "my curiosity.  Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his\n",
      "island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,\n",
      "with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and\n",
      "sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.  With other men, perhaps, such\n",
      "things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented\n",
      "with an everlasting itch for things remote.  I love to sail forbidden\n",
      "seas, and land on barbarous coasts.  Not ignoring what is good, I am\n",
      "quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would\n",
      "they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all\n",
      "the inmates of the place one lodges in.\n",
      "\n",
      "By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\n",
      "great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\n",
      "conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\n",
      "my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of\n",
      "them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\n",
      "arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.  Quitting the good\n",
      "city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.  It was a\n",
      "Saturday night in December.  Much was I disappointed upon learning\n",
      "that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no\n",
      "way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop\n",
      "at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as\n",
      "well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.  For my\n",
      "mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because\n",
      "there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected\n",
      "with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.  Besides\n",
      "though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the\n",
      "business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is\n",
      "now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre\n",
      "of this Carthage;--the place where the first dead American whale was\n",
      "stranded.  Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal\n",
      "whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the\n",
      "Leviathan?  And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first\n",
      "adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported\n",
      "cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to\n",
      "discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\n",
      "bowsprit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before\n",
      "me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it\n",
      "became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep\n",
      "meanwhile.  It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and\n",
      "dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.  I knew no one in the\n",
      "place.  With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only\n",
      "brought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael,\n",
      "said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street\n",
      "shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with\n",
      "the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you may\n",
      "conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire\n",
      "the price, and don't be too particular.\n",
      "\n",
      "With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \"The\n",
      "Crossed Harpoons\"--but it looked too expensive and jolly there.\n",
      "Further on, from the bright red windows of the \"Sword-Fish Inn,\"\n",
      "there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the\n",
      "packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the\n",
      "congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic\n",
      "pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the\n",
      "flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles\n",
      "of my boots were in a most miserable plight.  Too expensive and\n",
      "jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare\n",
      "in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.\n",
      "But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear? get away from\n",
      "before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.  So on I\n",
      "went.  I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward,\n",
      "for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either\n",
      "hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a\n",
      "tomb.  At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that\n",
      "quarter of the town proved all but deserted.  But presently I came to\n",
      "a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which\n",
      "stood invitingly open.  It had a careless look, as if it were meant\n",
      "for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was\n",
      "to stumble over an ash-box in the porch.  Ha! thought I, ha, as the\n",
      "flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that\n",
      "destroyed city, Gomorrah?  But \"The Crossed Harpoons,\" and \"The\n",
      "Sword-Fish?\"--this, then must needs be the sign of \"The Trap.\"\n",

      "on and opened a second, interior door.\n",

      "It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.  A hundred\n",
      "black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black\n",

      "looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and\n",
      "the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have\n",
      "been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side\n",

      "though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.  But it's too\n",
      "late to make any improvements now.  The universe is finished; the\n",

      "by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and\n",
      "careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an\n",
      "understanding of its purpose.  Such unaccountable masses of shades\n",
      "and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young\n",

      "portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\n",
      "picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\n",
      "nameless yeast.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to\n",

      "Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering\n",
      "there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an\n",

      "of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\n",
      "round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\n",
      "mower.  You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous\n",

      "a hacking, horrifying implement.  Mixed with these were rusty old\n",

      "it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at\n",

      "At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\n",

      "said he couldn't afford it.  Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,\n",
      "each in a winding sheet.  We were fain to button up our monkey\n",

      "\n",
      "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\n",

      "their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\n",
      "comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\n",
      "icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had\n",
      "just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they\n",
      "entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the\n",
      "whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there\n",
      "officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained\n",
      "of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like\n",
      "potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for\n",
      "all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,\n",
      "or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side\n",
      "of an ice-island.\n",

      "capering about most obstreperously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\n",
      "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\n",
      "own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\n",
      "noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the\n",
      "sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\n",
      "but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),\n",
      "I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full\n",
      "six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a\n",
      "coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was\n",
      "deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\n",
      "contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some\n",
      "reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at\n",
      "once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\n",
      "thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\n",
      "Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions\n",
      "had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I\n",
      "saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few\n",
      "minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it\n",
      "seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry\n",
      "of \"Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of\n",
      "the house in pursuit of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\n",
      "myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to\n",
      "the entrance of the seamen.\n",
      "\n",
      "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal\n",
      "rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes\n",
      "to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\n",
      "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\n",
      "indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\n",
      "sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors\n",
      "no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To\n",
      "be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your\n",
      "own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in\n",
      "your own skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\n",
      "thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a\n",
      "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be\n",
      "of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all\n",
      "over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought\n",
      "to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon\n",
      "me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\n",
      "coming?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't\n",
      "sleep with him.  I'll try the bench here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\n",
      "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots\n",
      "and notches.  \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's\n",
      "plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\"\n",
      "So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\n",
      "first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\n",
      "the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;\n",
      "till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.\n",
      "The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for\n",
      "heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did\n",
      "not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a\n",
      "pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and\n",
      "throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went\n",
      "about his business, and left me in a brown study.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\n",
      "short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too\n",
      "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\n",
      "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the\n",
      "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\n",
      "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.\n",
      "But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me\n",
      "from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\n",
      "all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one\n",
      "from the window, and both together formed a series of small\n",
      "whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought\n",
      "to spend the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I\n",
      "steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\n",
      "not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad\n",
      "idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell\n",
      "but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the\n",
      "harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me\n",
      "down!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\n",
      "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I\n",
      "began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable\n",
      "prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait\n",
      "awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at\n",
      "him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after\n",
      "all--there's no telling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and\n",
      "threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep\n",

      "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\n",
      "belongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I\n",

      "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\n",
      "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of\n",

      "what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe\n",

      "be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just\n",

      "\n",
      "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and\n",
      "showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling\n",
      "me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who\n",
      "stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged\n",
      "in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n",
      "\n",

      "Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There's\n",
      "plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty\n",
      "big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and\n",
      "little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling\n",
      "about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\n",
      "near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come\n",
      "along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted\n",
      "a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I\n",
      "stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed\n",
      "\"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come\n",
      "to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I\n",
      "was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure\n",
      "enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\n",
      "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\n",
      "chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\n",
      "make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"  I turned\n",
      "round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of\n",
      "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then\n",
      "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\n",
      "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude\n",
      "shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man\n",
      "striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,\n",
      "there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\n",
      "corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's\n",
      "wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a\n",
      "parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\n",
      "fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to\n",
      "the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\n",
      "arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare\n",
      "it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\n",
      "little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills\n",
      "round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of\n",
      "this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could\n",
      "it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,\n",
      "and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\n",
      "I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\n",
      "uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\n",
      "this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I\n",
      "went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\n",
      "saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\n",
      "that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time\n",
      "on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\n",
      "stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,\n",
      "and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel\n",
      "very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\n",
      "landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that\n",
      "night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\n",
      "my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\n",
      "bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\n",
      "sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\n",
      "pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I\n",
      "heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\n",
      "come into the room from under the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
      "head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\n",
      "word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\n",
      "New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\n",
      "without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\n",
      "from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at\n",
      "the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\n",
      "room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\n",
      "for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This\n",
      "accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a\n",
      "sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here\n",
      "and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's\n",
      "just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,\n",
      "got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at\n",
      "that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\n",
      "plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\n",
      "squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At\n",
      "first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\n",
      "truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a\n",
      "whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by\n",
      "them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant\n",
      "voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,\n",
      "thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in\n",
      "any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly\n",
      "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\n",
      "completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it\n",
      "might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\n",
      "heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\n",
      "However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\n",
      "there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while\n",
      "all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\n",
      "harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty\n",
      "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently\n",
      "pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\n",
      "on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he\n",
      "then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed\n",
      "it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver\n",
      "hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no\n",
      "hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small\n",
      "scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now\n",
      "looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger\n",
      "stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\n",
      "than ever I bolted a dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,\n",
      "but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make\n",
      "of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\n",
      "comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely\n",
      "nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as\n",
      "much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\n",
      "into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him\n",
      "that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a\n",
      "satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\n",
      "showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him\n",
      "were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\n",
      "all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\n",
      "Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\n",
      "Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green\n",
      "frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite\n",
      "plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\n",
      "of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian\n",
      "country.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps\n",
      "the heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to\n",
      "mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n",
      "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\n",
      "that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or\n",
      "wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\n",
      "fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\n",
      "deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a\n",
      "three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\n",
      "I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\n",
      "in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,\n",
      "and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded\n",
      "that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to\n",
      "be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing\n",
      "the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like\n",
      "a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks\n",
      "inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\n",
      "appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n",
      "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and\n",
      "places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\n",
      "biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\n",
      "shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty\n",
      "snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\n",
      "(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\n",
      "in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a\n",
      "little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the\n",
      "little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\n",
      "never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by\n",
      "still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\n",
      "praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\n",
      "during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\n",
      "At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\n",
      "unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\n",
      "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\n",
      "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\n",
      "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\n",
      "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in\n",
      "which I had so long been bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\n",
      "one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of\n",
      "it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\n",
      "at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next\n",
      "moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\n",
      "between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not\n",
      "help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\n",
      "feeling me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\n",
      "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\n",
      "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But\n",
      "his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill\n",
      "comprehended my meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\n",
      "kill-e.\"  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about\n",
      "me in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I.  \"Landlord!\n",
      "Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled\n",
      "the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered\n",
      "the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on\n",
      "fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the\n",
      "room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here\n",
      "wouldn't harm a hair of your head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that\n",
      "that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads\n",
      "around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.  Queequeg, look\n",
      "here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Me sabbee plenty\"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\n",
      "sitting up in bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\n",
      "throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a\n",
      "civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a\n",
      "moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\n",
      "looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,\n",
      "thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has\n",
      "just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.\n",
      "Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,\n",
      "or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I\n",
      "will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed\n",
      "with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\n",
      "motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to\n",
      "say--I won't touch a leg of ye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good night, landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned in, and never slept better in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm\n",
      "thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had\n",
      "almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of\n",
      "patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;\n",
      "and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\n",
      "labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\n",
      "shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically\n",
      "in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\n",
      "times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a\n",
      "strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as\n",
      "the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the\n",
      "quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\n",
      "sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was\n",
      "hugging me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was\n",
      "a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell\n",
      "me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\n",
      "settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper\n",
      "or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\n",
      "seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\n",
      "somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\n",
      "supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\n",
      "packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon\n",
      "of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I\n",
      "felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\n",
      "to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\n",
      "possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\n",
      "sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\n",
      "elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!\n",
      "the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;\n",
      "the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\n",
      "the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt\n",
      "worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\n",
      "my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\n",
      "myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a\n",
      "good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning\n",
      "me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the\n",
      "best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to\n",
      "my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great\n",
      "deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\n",
      "subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled\n",
      "nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in\n",
      "dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\n",
      "in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\n",
      "frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\n",
      "supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the\n",
      "counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\n",
      "to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\n",
